This report describes the design decisions, accomplishments and evaluation of the work done by Group 9 during the course DD2425 Robotics and Autonomous Systems. 
In summary the robot uses an occupancy grid and a topoloical map to navigate in the maze, and the 3D information from the primesense camera together with PCL for object recognition.
In the end the system worked well enough to solve the whole task in simple cases.
